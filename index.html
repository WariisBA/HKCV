                    Started as basic agent resolving basic queries from customers, however for both projects involved I transitioned 
                    in dealing with backend tasks and working directly with the companies we were being outsourced to. Range of my tasks 
                    was, in short, generating daily tasks for our team, QA for tech issues, analyzing data to confirm production is on point,
                    rectifying data entered by user, resolving interactions requiring a manager and large compensations.

                    Was working as an outbound cold call agent presenting trading solutions. This was my first official work experience
                    and was done between my last two semesters in college. I was speaking with customers from all around the world and
                    this helped me later on to be able to adjust to working with any market as long as they were able to speak English.

                    Basically what started as a hobby, turned out to be a very profitable business I managed on the side. Back when
                    installing an OS required actual knowledge, I was having multiple customers weekly. I was also doing the other
                    usual stuff associated, such as removing malware, fixing software and hardware issues, educating about software use
                    and of course turning things off and on.

                    Since I had very advanced knowledge of English from early age, I decided to capitalize on this and have 
                    translated all sorts of documents on request with very satisfied customers who received very good marks on "their" work.

                    As part of my internship during college, I was assigned to work on the official faculty page during the last two semesters. 
                    We were mentored by the head of IT, as well as multiple professors. Project was done using jQuery framework aside from usual HTML5/CSS.

                Computers are my second nature, I have been using PC's extensively throughout my whole life and have done projects 
                in multiple areas including graphic design, coding, video editing, gaming and probably more. I have excellent 
                English skills in both writing and speaking. Ability to work under high pressure situations and to self-motivate. 
                Great team player, while also being able to carry out solo projects. Very quick learner and extremely good at Googling things!
